                        For the longest time of my life I pursued a career in sports. 
                        I had a passion for Martial Arts namely Taekwondo and I held the
                        4th Dan, a degree where others had to call me Master. I taught beginner
                        and advanced classes and was the leader of our demonstration team.
                        I learned to lead and teach to emphatize and understand people and their
                        unique upbringing. I learned to adjust my style to the person in front
                        of me and strived to never stop learning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While teaching Martial Arts I worked in retail. I was an employee at
                        the Dutch variety chain store HEMA. I was working in logistics, sales and
                        as a cashier. I was responsible for organizing the stock after the opening
                        of the store in Frankfurt am Main and made contributions for the grand opening
                        of the Frankfurt Branch.
                        I learned to organize large amount of stocks and how to work in a team. I also 
                        had the role of "Vertrauensperson" and was responsible for team atmosphere and 
                        communication with our Branch Manager.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working at Bauhaus in the logistics department. I am responsible for stock, 
                        presentation and every other task that comes up that no other is responsible to
                        do. I do a variety of things like painting, building, improvising solutions and 
                        repairing.
                        I learn a lot of improvising and creating solutions with limited resources. I 
                        learn to drive forklifts and other heavy machinery.
                        While working at Bauhaus I always tried to expand my skillset and picked up
                        learning to code while working on Harvards CS50x Intro to Computer Science Course
                        which seemed to open a whole new world to me. I was always technically inclined
                        and had a lot of interest in PC's, gaming and other technical devices such as 
                        MP3 Players and consoles.
